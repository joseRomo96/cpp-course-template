## 1.0 Purpose of the Template

The repository provides:

1. **A clean separation** between *instructor reference code* and *student implementation code*.  
2. **Automatic discovery** of examples and tests using CMake naming conventions.  
3. **Documentation generation** through Doxygen.  
4. **Continuous integration** via CTest + GitHub Actions.  
5. **Scaffolding for modular design**, showing industry-standard practices.

The goal is for students to learn C++ within a reproducible, professional framework.
