## 10.0 Summary — What Lesson 0 Teaches

By the end of Lesson 0, students fully understand:

- repository structure  
- file placement rules  
- naming conventions  
- CMake target architecture  
- public vs private APIs  
- example executables  
- unit test interaction  
- documentation structure  

Students can now safely begin implementation inside:

```
student/src/
student/include/
```
