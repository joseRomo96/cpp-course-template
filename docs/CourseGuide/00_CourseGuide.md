# Course Guide Overview

The **Course Guide** introduces the structure, workflow, and documentation model
used throughout the C++ Course Template. It explains how students and instructors
interact with the repository and provides a unified entry point for all related topics.

The guide covers:

- how to clone and configure the repository
- how the directory structure is organized
- how to build and test the project locally
- how to run coverage and generate reports
- how Doxygen is used to document the code
- how the GitHub workflow validates student submissions

Use this page as the starting point for exploring all topics in the Course Guide.
